Project: GoNow Foods Suite

Overview:
The GoNow Foods Suite comprises three interconnected applications: GoNow Foods, GoNow Foods Courier, and GoNow Administrative Dashboard. These applications interact with a single backend application to ensure data exchange for effective application performance. These applications collectively provide a comprehensive solution for food delivery services, catering to both customers and administrative staff.

1. GoNow Foods - User's Application: https://github.com/QDUBS/GoNowFoods

2. GoNow Foods Courier: https://github.com/QDUBS/GoNowCourier

3. GoNow Administrative Dashboard: https://github.com/QDUBS/GoNowFoods-Dashboard

4. GoNow Backend: Architecture Overview:

The backend system serves as the backbone for the GoNow Foods Suite, orchestrating seamless communication and data exchange among the User's Application, Courier Application, and Administrative Dashboard. Key components and functionalities include:

a. Shared Backend:
Developed a shared backend to serve the entire application suite, comprising GoNow Foods, GoNow Foods Courier, and GoNow Administrative Dashboard. This approach promotes code reuse, consistency, and centralized management of core functionalities.

b. Order Processing:
Efficiently handled order processing, including placement, modification, and cancellation, ensuring accurate forwarding to relevant restaurants. Utilized robust algorithms to manage order queues and optimize delivery routes for couriers.

c. Real-time Communication:
Implemented Apache Kafka for real-time communication, enabling instant updates and notifications for all stakeholders. This ensures timely and accurate information exchange between users, couriers, and administrative staff.

d. Authentication and Authorization:
Managed user authentication and authorization to ensure secure handling of credentials for customers and restaurant staff. Implemented industry-standard protocols and encryption techniques to safeguard sensitive information.

e. Courier Assignment and Tracking:
Implemented algorithms for courier assignment and tracking, considering factors like location and availability for optimal order delivery. Integrated with location-based services to track courier movements in real-time.

f. Restaurant Management:
Supported restaurant management functionalities on the Administrative Dashboard, enabling menu updates, order acknowledgment, and real-time inventory management. This facilitates seamless coordination between restaurants and the delivery system.

g. Scalability and Containerization:
Engineered for scalability, designing the backend to handle a high volume of concurrent users and transactions. Leveraged Docker and Docker Hub for containerization, enabling easy deployment and scaling of microservices.

h. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
Utilized GitHub Actions and Concourse CI to build a robust CI/CD pipeline, ensuring efficient codebase changes deployment. This promotes automation, consistency, and reliability in the development and deployment process.

i. Container Orchestration:
Implemented Kubernetes for container orchestration, providing automated management of containerized applications. Deployed the application to AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for optimal scalability, performance, and reliability.

Conclusion:
The backend architecture for the GoNow Foods Suite is designed to be robust, scalable, and secure, enabling seamless communication and efficient handling of orders, deliveries, and administrative tasks. By leveraging technologies such as Apache Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS, the backend system ensures high availability, performance, and reliability while facilitating continuous integration and deployment for rapid iteration and improvement of the application suite.
The GoNow Foods Suite offers a comprehensive solution for food delivery services, catering to the needs of customers, delivery personnel, and administrative staff alike. By leveraging technologies such as Google Maps, Google Locations, and secure payment gateways, the suite delivers a seamless and secure experience for users while optimizing efficiency and reliability in order management and delivery operations.
